**Live Deployment:** [urbanguard-ai.vercel.app](https://urbanguard-ai.vercel.app/)

Formed at the intersection of innovation and urban resilience, **UrbanGuard AI** is a cutting-edge infrastructure auditing platform designed to safeguard the critical assets that power modern metropolises. Built by **Team Smart Nova**, this platform leverages real-time diagnostics and neural analytics to provide a centralized command HUD for urban infrastructure health.

## Technology Stack

### **Frontend Architecture**
- **Framework**: [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router) for high-performance server-side rendering and routing.
- **UI Engine**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with a custom **Glassmorphism Design System**.
- **Motion Orchestration**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for ultra-smooth 120fps physics animations and micro-interactions.
- **Iconography**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) for precise, tactile visual symbols.

### **State & Logic**
- **Global State**: [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction) for efficient, persistent cross-region data synchronization.
- **Intelligence Layer**: Simulated **Neural Response Engine** for multi-region infrastructure auditing and predictive risk assessment.

## Feature Ecosystem

### 1. **Global Network Matrix (Dashboard)**
- **Multi-Region Diagnostics**: Simultaneous monitoring of Chennai and Coimbatore infrastructure nodes.
- **System Integrity Score**: A real-time calculated health index powered by weighted anomaly decay logic.
- **Topological Overview**: Aggregated stats for Bridges, Transformers, Water Pipes, and Traffic Signals.

### 2. **Universal AI Analyst (Full-Screen Chat)**
- **Multi-Region Redirection**: A dedicated full-screen command center accessible via a kinetic "Maximize" transition.
- **Predictive Query Engine**: AI capable of answering complex multi-region questions (e.g., "Compare bridge stability between Chennai and CBE").
- **Neural Query Hints**: Dynamic suggestions to help users discover deep-dive infrastructure insights.

### 3. **Asset Inventory Hub**
- **Precision Filtering**: Advanced UISelect components to filter by **Status** (Healthy, Warning, Critical) or **Asset Type**.
- **Health-Driven Sorting**: Dynamically reorder assets based on Health Score (High/Low) or Alphabetical hierarchy.
- **Tactical Profile Cards**: Detailed cards showing regional context, battery integrity, and stress levels.

### 4. **Tactical Heatmaps & Leaderboards**
- **Regional Stress Mapping**: Visualizing sensor density and risk clusters across city sectors.
- **Risk Leaderboard**: A prioritized list of "At-Risk" assets ranked by their threat potential and failure probability.

### 5. **Control Center (Settings)**
- **Visual Protocols**: Toggle **Ultra Motion** (120fps physics) and **Neural Background** (particle field rendering).
- **Notification Matrix**: Fully active toggle system for Critical Breach Alerts and Neural Anomaly Warnings.
- **Authentication Kernel**: Visual representation of Biometric Gate protocols for uplink integrity.
